Only issue I had was I did not know this was formatted in X-FAT32. I bought this thumb drive to put the movies I have on my PC on it so that I could watch them in my living room on my smart tv... after spending a couple hours transferring files to the drive, I plug it into my smart tv and get an error telling me that the drive was not supported. I tried it on my Sony Blu-ray that has a usb slot for external media and it doesn\u2019t recognize the drive either. I tell my husband about it and he says I need to format the thumb drive with a regular FAT32 file system. Well, I did as I was instructed, reloaded the movies after formatting with FAT32 and bingo! Both my smart tv and my Blu-ray can now read the files on the drive! So, if anyone has problems with your devices reading or even recognizing the drive after loading files in the X-FAT32 format, reformat the drive with FAT32 and then reload your files.

The ONLY reason for buying this laptop was gone. In addition to this blatant and very obvious marketing trick (see \"false advertisement\") I also found out that this 2021, modern 'gaming' laptop was not equipped for VR, could not connect two external monitors, the HDMI rating went from 2.1 to 2.0 (another so-called misprint), which meant 4K ran at 60hz, 8k wasn't possible at all and, thanks to absence of video/thunderbolt support usb-c there was no way to ever connect a decent VR headset, which meant that if I ever wanted to use HP Reverb 2 I would have to buy a new pc.In addition, there are other issues: the usb rating (usb 3.1 gen 2) is a rebranded, confusing way of saying that this, again, 2021 gaming laptop only has an old USB 3.0 without video, no displayport, the 180watt power supply gets very hot, same as the motherboard and the ssd, there is no sata port (blocked by a poorly placed battery), no Dolby (they use something called Nahimic, it's horrible), the display has a native refresh rate of only 100hz and needs overdrive enabled to run at 144, it's also of a very poor quality and mainly displays blue colors, making everything look very unnatural.Lastly, something that forced me to return it, was the fact that, in the middle of the game or when downloading many files, the system would just shut off on its own!!! I suffered 20 or 30 shutdowns before I called amazon and set up the return. Seriously, how cheap do you have to be to remove a feature from the Usb-c port that even my old Lenovo has? My Lenovo isn't a gaming laptop and yet, being 5 years old, it can easily connect two additional monitors and display images on ALL OF THEM! Which isn't something I can do with MSI.I know they did this to distinguish this budget, bargain-basement model from their higher-end offerings but why make it in the first place? Also, what kind of a marketing team you have that allowed for misrepresentation of the very reason your end users would buy this laptop?! Msi should have known that almost every person who ended up finding out that the graphics card can't go naive 70 watts would return the laptop, which meant reselling it as used, aka losing money on every single one sold.Thank you for wasting my time, msi, I really appreciate the opportunity to buy and then return a semi-functioning laptop that never panned out.Other issues is thag its very noisy, very loud, processor throttles early and doesn't ever reach maximum frequency, plasticky, flimsy build, the TouchPad is difficult to operate, the rgb keyboard brightness can't be adjusted nor can ever be used effectively, it's also brighter than the very dim display. The display is NOT HRD, with about 58% srgb coverage, very poor quality.Comes with a slow-usb Kingston ssd, ram is fast but has high latency for some reason, the clock can't be adjusted because the BIOS is a pure mess.I can go on and on but, all I can really say is this: don't buy it! Spend couple of hundred dollars more and buy a vastly superior QHD HP Omen 17, with a potent 140watt 3070, gorgeous qhd screen, fully enabled 11800h, better ram, thunderbolt/usb/pcie4.Amazon said they won't charge me anything to return this piece of you-know-what, can't wait to see if they told the truth.I won't buy another msi product ever again.

The copper plate that goes over the cpu die only makes 20% contact on the left side. The right side is completely angled up. In order to alleviate this, I placed a 20mm x 20mm x 1mm copper shim between the cpu die and the copper plate of the cooling system.Now it makes full contact, but the cooling is still kinda meh. Even with a -65mv undervolt and a cooling pad, I couldn't sustain the full 4.2ghz clock speed during testing, instead it drops to ~3.4ghz. Still, I got a cinebench r23 score of 10955. Not nearly as good as the 11800h in the mp66 version of this laptop. One dude on reddit received a score of 14603 with a 4.4ghz all core overclock, so that's a testament on how powerful the 11800h is.Some positives: the 80w 3070 (that's the target tgp, 85 is the tgp limit) performs similarly to a desktop 3060 and has a bit of cooling headroom. I personally got an undervolt-overclock of 1530mhz @ .700v. If you're up for it, you could probably flash the vbios with a more powerful 3070 mobile chip. Just make sure to clamp down on the voltage if the tgp of the vbios is 115w+.Also, the chassis has enough room to put thick heatsinks on the nvme drives.Overall, I think I'm gonna try the msi mg66 with the 125w 3070 since videos on line show it has better cooling.", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2021", "starRating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "5 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/MSI-GL66-Gaming-Laptop-i7-11800H/product-reviews/B09127DDVT?pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"}

I bought this thumb drive to put the movies I have on my PC on it so that I could watch them in my living room on my smart tv... after spending a couple hours transferring files to the drive, I plug it into my smart tv and get an error telling me that the drive was not supported. I tried it on my Sony Blu-ray that has a usb slot for external media and it doesn\u2019t recognize the drive either. I tell my husband about it and he says I need to format the thumb drive with a regular FAT32 file system. Well, I did as I was instructed, reloaded the movies after formatting with FAT32 and bingo! Both my smart tv and my Blu-ray can now read the files on the drive! So, if anyone has problems with your devices reading or even recognizing the drive after loading files in the X-FAT32 format, reformat the drive with FAT32 and then reload your files. You should be good to go! SANDISK, YOU REALLY SHOULD LABLE THE PACKAGING WITH THE TYPE OF FORMATING ON THE DRIVE! That would save people a lot of wasted time knowing this in advance!", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2017", "starRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "531 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/SanDisk-Cruzer-Glide-Drive-SDCZ60-128G-B35/product-reviews/B007YX9OGW?pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"}

The slider allows the user to protect the USB connector when not in use. It extends the connector and locks it in place when needed. However, the included SanDiskSecure Access software is confusing, because its \"Download for Mac\" document makes it seem that it is necessary to install in order to use the flash drive. But the software is intended to set up encryption and password protection for data on the drive. This is not needed for most users who just want to transfer data. I removed the software installer from this drive to free up space.", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2018", "starRating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "225 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/SanDisk-Cruzer-Glide-Drive-SDCZ60-128G-B35/product-reviews/B007YX9OGW?pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"}

{"names": "Batman", "reviewerLink": "/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGETSYUITOWSVFFI4GHIEJZKNEQA", "reviewTitles": "Speed Drops out of the box", "reviewBody": "This drive has a speed drop on every transfer, going from 18 MB/s to 2 MB/s. On the files I transferred, there was at least two speed drops each time. For perspective, this meant transfers that should take 1 minute each could take up to 3 or more minutes. The performance was like this out of the box. It's unacceptable for a product to be unable to consistently deliver target speeds out of the box, brand new. SanDisk was a go-to brand for storage, but with this experience it's clear something has changed in the quality. I'd say stay away from this drive and find something with more reliable speeds unless you have alot of time to waste. I'll be pursuing a refund if these speed drops don't stop.", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2017", "starRating": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "120 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/SanDisk-Cruzer-Glide-Drive-SDCZ60-128G-B35/product-reviews/B007YX9OGW?pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"}
