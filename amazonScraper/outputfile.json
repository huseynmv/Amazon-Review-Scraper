In order to charge the reader, I had to use a set of small electronics screwdrivers to carefully manipulate the female port pins into the proper location.Seems as though \"Certified Refurbished\" would mean that someone checked and certified the device for proper operation before selling it ever-so-slightly below the price of a new unit. Truly: buyers should go new and avoid the risk of defects like I have encountered.UPDATE: I have brought this up to three stars because Amazon reached out to ask what they, as a company that cares, could do to fix this problem. I did not ask for anything more than better QA/QC on refurbished products (I'm not the only charge port issue), and decided that since this reader is truly AMAZING: I'd better up my review to reflect the like. Definitely buy this model if you want amazing battery life and ultra-portable reading, but know that you are rolling the dice on quality if you choose refurbished.", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2019", "starRating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "481 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Certified-Refurbished-Kindle-Paperwhite-Ad-Supported/product-reviews/B077448K76?pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"}

My original baby kindle (circa 2011) finally croaked and I tried to get by with my iPad. It was okay but I kept getting headaches and decided to take a chance on the refurbished Paperwhite. I just took a photo of it in full sun so people can see the quality and make their own decisions. I am really pleased with this device even though it is not the same as my original kindle. Change is sometimes difficult- the option of having the backlight is actually surprisingly nice. I also appreciate the touchscreen rather than the clunky search and peck control. This is a good alternative for those on a budget.", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2019", "starRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "200 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Certified-Refurbished-Kindle-Paperwhite-Ad-Supported/product-reviews/B077448K76?pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"}

My husband and I had taken a trip to the beach and I could not see my screen even under the umbrella. I had thought about a Paperwhite, but wasn't sure I would get a lot of use out of it. My new \"regular\" Kindle is often and gets used quiete a bit for the internet, games, and yes reading, some days I run the battery pretty low, this was just another excuse to add a Paperwhite. I ordered a refurbished one hoping I really could see it in bright sun. WOW, I can see it even better than a paper page and there is no reflective glare. I love it! I hope I don't need the water protection feature, but let's face it the bright sun is usually near water. I am very happy with my purchase. I did order a regular wall power cord as I don't like charging off my computer, but all is well and I really love the Paperwhire, the only regret is that it took me so long to buy one.", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2019", "starRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "133 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/Certified-Refurbished-Kindle-Paperwhite-Ad-Supported/product-reviews/B077448K76?pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"}
